- I am building this app and this is just the prototype of the app which i have done on Adobe XD
- It is an app which helps people to track their medication,suppliment and water intake for a healthy life. 
It helps peoples  to follow their medication regularly as well as for an easy follow up 
of their medication by thier close family members or anyone concerned. In addition, It helps for 
a normal person to track his vitamins and water intake per day whereby he can have a healthy life style.

- the user get notification based on the time given for taking the moedication, incase the user forget to take the medication 
th app will notify the family memeber which will be added by the user. this feature will not work for the suppliment and water.
